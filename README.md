This script was made to easiely launch Minecraft Vanilla Servers for any version to play with my friends. It is made only considering LAN network with our private VPN system (tho, theoretically it should work with any network, if you forward all needed ports, or use something like Hamachi) and our private (for now, it wasn't made by me) file sharing system.

Feel free to modify code to your needs. If you implement something cool, be sure to make a pull request!
